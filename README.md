# Mini shop

## Overview

Mini shop is a simple online shopping store built for my personal learning and coding pleasure. I work on the shop for a few hours after work everyday and build it with a heavy focus on code cleaness, good practice/design patterns, and quality over speed. I strive to make it as (reasonably) complex as possible to expose myself to a wide range of problems (such as testing, integration, service implementation...) and force myself to learn and improve. The shop is still work in progress and only contains a backend system now. In the future, new features, a frontend, and an admin component will be added.

## Goals

Here are the goals set for this project:

  * Solid test suite: unit tests, integration tests, and good test coverage.
  * DRY and clean code.
  * Good separation of concerns and code reuse (mostly achieved via polymorphism and composition).
  * Good design patterns.
  * Mastery of the Ruby language.

## Releases

  * 0.1.0: Add support for simple account creation, shopping cart, payment/transaction, and fulfillment/reversal system.
  * 0.1.1: Add missing endpoints for a few services.
